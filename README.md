🧠 MarketMind

Predicting customer behavior, one decision at a time.

📊 Overview

MarketMind is a machine learning project developed during my internship at Skill Craft Technology.
It uses a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on demographic and behavioral data from the Bank Marketing dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository).

🚀 Objective

To build an interpretable classification model that helps financial institutions understand customer behavior and optimize marketing campaigns effectively.

📁 Dataset

Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository

File: bank-full.csv

Separator: ;

Features include: age, job, marital status, education, contact type, campaign count, and previous outcomes.

🧠 Approach
1. Data Preprocessing

Handled missing values and cleaned data.

Encoded categorical variables using LabelEncoder.

Structured the dataset for model training.

2. Model Training

Implemented DecisionTreeClassifier from scikit-learn.

Used entropy criterion for information gain-based splitting.

3. Evaluation & Visualization

Measured performance with accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report.

Visualized results using matplotlib, seaborn, and plot_tree.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries

Python 🐍

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib & Seaborn

scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

📈 Results

The model successfully predicted customer responses with high interpretability, offering key insights into how demographic and behavioral factors influence marketing success.

💡 Key Takeaway

MarketMind demonstrates how machine learning and analytics can enhance decision-making in the banking sector by transforming raw customer data into actionable intelligence.
